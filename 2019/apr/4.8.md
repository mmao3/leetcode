convert the sentence to string will be easier for quick checking any character. Then check the last character of every line.
We can maintain a globe variable "lenSum" to record total length from first line to last line.
At the beginning of every iteration, we add total column length to "lenSum", then we can keep putting
words in current length.
The key step is to check whether last character is a space or an alphabet
1. if it is a space, we do not need to trace back, since we already fill partial sentence in current line
2. if it is an alphabet, we need to trace back to find the most recent space position Overall, "lenSum" represents total effective length (有效长度), if the rest of line does not have enough
spots to fill out a word, we need to trace back to decrease the effective length. It means the rest of line
is ineffective length, which cannot be counted in "lenSum" 

Time complexity for this method is ```O(row * MAXLength(word))``` 

To optimize, pre calculate the position and it will be ```O(row)```

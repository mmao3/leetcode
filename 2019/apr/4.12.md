This is one of my favorite problems although I am not able to solve it optimally by myself. The easiest way to solve it is using brute force. For each iteration, it needs ```O(n)``` time therefore the total time complexity is ```O(n^2)```. To speed up, we need to find a way for quicker look up for next higher or lower value. Balanced BST seems promising since it has ```log(n)``` complexity in all operations. Loop backward and use arrays to store the values that have been computed.

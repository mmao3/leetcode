The idea is trying to find the candidate from right to left. Find a bigger digit and that's the answer if it is valid otherwise set it the smallest number and repeat the process. For example, 23:59, Starting from 9,  since there is no bigger digit, set it to the smallest one, which is 2. For 5, next greater value is 9, however, 23:92 is not a valid time, therefore, set it to 2. For 3, next greater value is 5, but 25:22 is not valid, set it to 2 as well. For 2, next greater value is 3, since 32:22 is not valid, our final answer is 22:22.

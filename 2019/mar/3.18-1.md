This problem is equivalent to finding the maximum subarray with 2 elements. Sliding window approach could be used. Time complexity is ```0(n)``` and space complexity is ```0(n)``` for this approach. Another approach is to maintain two variables which record the last positions of possible candidates. We need to reset the variables and counter when we meet a third one.

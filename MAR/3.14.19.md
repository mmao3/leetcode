### **Interate over time**
supposing day i is the candidate : 
```
cur_pos = flowers[i], low_pos = cur_pos - k - 1, high_pos = cur + k + 1
```
To satisfy the conditions, any of the followings must be ture:
- low_pos is valid and the flower at it is blooming; all flowers between low_pos and cur_pos are not blooming 
- high_pos is valid and the flower at it is blooming; all flowers between cur_pos and high_pos are not blooming 

How to find out all flowers are not blooming? <br />
Doing it one by one will result in ```0(nk)``` time complexty. To be faster, using a BST will have ```0(nlog(n))``` time 

### **Interate over position**
```days[i]``` denoted as blooming daty at position i - 1 <br />
```(l, r)``` denoted as a candiate range. Interating from l + 1 to r - 1 one by one could tell whether it is a valid range. Supposing at k where ```l < k < r```, it breaks the rule. All ranges ```(i', j')``` where ``` l < i' < k ``` are not valid ranges, therefore, next range could start at k. The overall time complexty is ```0(n)```
